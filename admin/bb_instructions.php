  <h2>Installation Directions</h2>
	<h3>Please read all directions prior to use!</h3>
<strong>1.</strong> Create a page in your blog that will display the web directory. To do that use the "Pages" feature of your WordPress Dashboard. Click "Add New" to begin to create the page. Type the short tag "<font color="red">[bungeebones_directory]"</font> (without the quotes) somewhere on the page. <br /><br />
<strong>2.</strong> Decide whether you wish to participate in the income earning aspects of BungeeBones. It is recommended (but not required) by BungeeBones that you do. All that you need to do to make your installation eligible to earn income is to register and add the site information at BungeeBones.com. Visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.BungeeBones.com/articles/add_a_link.php">www.BungeeBones.com</a> to register as a user and add your link to the web directory. As you register, BungeeBones will report your Link ID/Affiliate Number. Please write that number down for future reference. The BungeeBones system offers free or paid positions that advertise a website on all the other installations and make it eligible to receive their own directory and commissions on sales a site makes.<br /><br />
		<strong>3.</strong> If you decided to register and have, indeed, registered then click the "Registered" link (in the left menu) and submit the form by clicking the button at the bottom of that page. The plugin should find your site's registration in the BungeeBones database and get your installation connected to the BungeeBones server<br /><br />
		<strong>4.</strong> If you have <b>NOT</b> registered then click the "Non_Registered" link (in the left menu) and submit the form by clicking the button at the bottom of that page. The plugin will add your site's registration itself (automatically) into the BungeeBones database as a non-affiliated and unadvertised  website. It, too, will get your installation connected to the BungeeBones server<br /><br />
	<strong>5.</strong> Go to your blog page with your web browser. You should now have a link in your nav bar to the directory page. Click that and inspect the install. It should have all the categories and links. Click a category and make sure the links are loading properly. Links to advertising websites should be displayed and there should be an "Add A Link" button at the bottom of it. Clicking that will open a popup that forewarns users that they will be leaving your site but if you are registered then the number in the page's URL should match the number you got in step 2 above. If not, BungeeBones requests that you please contact their tech support.  <br /><br />
<strong>6.</strong> Go to the Styles page and set the directory's CSS style information.<br /><br />
		
Note: If you change your permalink settings you may need to re-configure the plugin (i.e. run step 3 or 4 again).

   <h2>Optional Dynamic Header Setup</h2>
    <p> Now you will need to copy the plugin file "bb_dyn_hdr.php" to your theme folder (in wp-content/themes/your-theme-name). This dynamic header feature requires some coding skill and experience.<br /><br />
		<p>After copying the bb_dyn_hdr.php to your theme directory rename its current "header.php" page to header_bak.php. Then rename the newly installed bb_dyn_hdr.php to header.php.<br /><br />
		<strong>Option 1</strong> (Recommended): Simply drop the this line of code into your theme file that controls your header (usually header.php)
		<br /><br />
Note: If you need to make any coding changes to get dynamic headers to work the location to add this code can vary widely from theme to theme. The new header.php page contains new code until line 71. After that, the code there is identical to the code in the oriniginal header.php page. The current file is from the default WordPress theme "twentyeleven". You may have to copy and paste code from your own template.
<p>In principal, the dynamic header code will produce the first part of the &lt;head&gt; section and uses the original theme code for the closing part of the &lt;head&gt; section. The dynamic code creates the title, description and keywords meta tags. You may have to replace the current code (after line 71 and after the dynamic code) to place your correct style sheet links and theme coding.  
		<br /><br /><code>&lt;?php 
	
<p>You can then configure the variables in the Header config form however you see fit. They will make each particular category page have unique titles, description and keywords for the catgeory being displayed. The setting also make the pages unique to your website by changing the title, description and keywords.<br />
<p>In each meta tag (i.e. title, description, keywords) you can insert [cat_name] placeholders. Wherever you enter [cat_name] it will be replaced with the real category being displayed.
<p>EXAMPLES:<br>
A title might have "Great [cat_name] Links!" in the settings. When someone was viewing the Computers results the title would be "Great Computer Links!". In the business category it would display "Great Business Links!"
<p>You can also set the 'robots" metatag to whatever setting you want.
